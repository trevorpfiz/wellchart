# T3 Turbo x Supabase

![CleanShot 2023-04-11 at 23 42 53@2x](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51714798/231294720-1c64b391-4ecf-42d2-aad2-8c486c5d6bf5.png)

## About

This is an extended version of [create-t3-turbo](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-turbo) implementing authentication using [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) on both the web and mobile applications.

### Side note for mobile

**iOS:** One of the requirements for Apple's review process requires you to implement native `Sign in with Apple` if you're providing any other third party authentication method. Read more in [Section 4.8 - Design: Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#sign-in-with-apple).

We have preconfigured this for you which you can find [here](./apps/expo/src/utils/auth.ts). All you need to do is to enable the Apple Provider in your [Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com) and fill in your information.

> We currently only supports `Sign in with Apple` - support for more providers on mobile are being worked on!

## Quick Start

To get it running, follow the steps below:

### Setup dependencies

```diff
# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Configure environment variables.
# There is an `.env.example` in the root directory you can use for reference
cp .env.example .env

# Push the Drizzle schema to your database (w/ drizzle-kit push)
pnpm db:push

# Or use migrations (w/ drizzle-kit generate and drizzle-kit migrate)
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

> Migrations seem preferable for Supabase. Still figuring out the best way to do migrations for local development/branching. <https://twitter.com/plushdohn/status/1780126181490135371>

### Setting up Supabase

1. Go to [the Supabase dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/projects) and create a new project.
2. Under project settings, retrieve the environment variables `reference id`, `project url` & `anon public key` and paste them into [.env](./.env.example) and [apps/expo/.env](./apps/expo/.env.example) in the necessary places. You'll also need the database password you set when creating the project.
3. Under `Auth`, configure any auth provider(s) of your choice. This repo is using Github for Web and Apple for Mobile.
4. If you want to use the `Email` provider and `email confirmation`, go to `Auth` -> `Email Templates` and change the `Confirm signup` from `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` to `{{ .RedirectTo }}&token_hash={{ .TokenHash }}&type=signup`, according to <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls#email-templates-when-using-redirectto>. `.RedirectTo` will need to be added to your `Redirect URLs` in the next step.
5. Under `Auth` -> `URL Configuration`, set the `Site URL` to your production URL and add `http://localhost:3000/**` and `https://*-username.vercel.app/**` to `Redirect URLs` as detailed here <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/redirect-urls#vercel-preview-urls>.
6. Setup a trigger when a new user signs up: <https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/managing-user-data#using-triggers>. Can run this in the SQL Editor.

   ```sql
   -- inserts a row into public.profile
   create function public.handle_new_user()
   returns trigger
   language plpgsql
   security definer set search_path = public
   as $$
   begin
     insert into public.t3turbo_profile (id, email, name, image)
     values (
       new.id,
       new.email,
       COALESCE(
         new.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'name',
         new.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'full_name',
         new.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'user_name',
         '[redacted]'
       ),
       new.raw_user_meta_data ->> 'avatar_url'
     )
     on conflict (id) do update set
       email = excluded.email,
       name = excluded.name,
       image = excluded.image;
     return new;
   end;
   $$;

   -- trigger the function every time a user is created
   create trigger on_auth_user_created
     after insert on auth.users
     for each row execute procedure public.handle_new_user();

   -- trigger the function when a user signs in/their email is confirmed to get missing values if any
   create trigger on_auth_user_verified
     after update on auth.users
     for each row when (
       old.last_sign_in_at is null
       and new.last_sign_in_at is not null
     ) execute procedure public.handle_new_user();
   ```

   ```sql
   -- drop a trigger if needed
   drop trigger "on_auth_user_verified" on auth.users;
   ```

7. Remove access to the `public` schema as we are only using the server

By default, Supabase exposes the `public` schema to the PostgREST API to allow the `supabase-js` client query the database directly from the client. However, since we route all our requests through the Next.js application (through tRPC), we don't want our client to have this access. To disable this, execute the following SQL query in the SQL Editor on your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
REVOKE USAGE ON SCHEMA public FROM anon, authenticated;
```

![disable public access](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51714798/231810706-88b1db82-0cfd-485f-9043-ef12a53dc62f.png)

> Note: This means you also don't need to enable row-level security (RLS) on your database if you don't want to.

### Configure Expo `dev`-script

#### Use iOS Simulator

1. Make sure you have XCode and XCommand Line Tools installed [as shown on expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/).

   > **NOTE:** If you just installed XCode, or if you have updated it, you need to open the simulator manually once. Run `npx expo start` in the root dir, and then enter `I` to launch Expo Go. After the manual launch, you can run `pnpm dev` in the root directory.

   ```diff
   +  "dev": "expo start --ios",
   ```

2. Run `pnpm dev` at the project root folder.

> **TIP:** It might be easier to run each app in separate terminal windows so you get the logs from each app separately. This is also required if you want your terminals to be interactive, e.g. to access the Expo QR code. You can run `pnpm --filter expo dev` and `pnpm --filter nextjs dev` to run each app in a separate terminal window.

#### For Android

1. Install Android Studio tools [as shown on expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/).
2. Change the `dev` script at `apps/expo/package.json` to open the Android emulator.

   ```diff
   +  "dev": "expo start --android",
   ```

3. Run `pnpm dev` at the project root folder.

### Keyboard Avoiding in React Native

Choose one of these (Requires [Development Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)):

1. [react-native-keyboard-controller](https://github.com/kirillzyusko/react-native-keyboard-controller)
2. [react-native-avoid-softinput](https://github.com/mateusz1913/react-native-avoid-softinput)

If you need an Expo Go option:

1. [react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view](https://github.com/APSL/react-native-keyboard-aware-scroll-view)

> **NOTE:** I would not be worried about using development builds. It is the standard way to develop Expo apps. You create a development build once with the native packages installed, and then you get all the benefits of hot reloading etc.
